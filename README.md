# React + Vite
# First time using Vite, I was wanting to also practice some useReducer and CSS
# this is just a practice file overall wanted to try some new things
# run nvm install node to turn on node 21
# run npm run dev to start server

# Notes:
useReducer is a react hook used for handling more complex state managment.
Basic setup: const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, STATE).
state is base state when page is loaded, dispatch is the action performed on state.
useReducer() takes in a reducer function and initial state variable.






This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
